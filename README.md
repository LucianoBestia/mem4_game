# mem4_game
Learning Rust Wasm/WebAssembly with Virtual Dom Dodrio and WebSocket communication - part four.
## TODO:
In mem3 I plan to:
- better documentation. Do I really have to write very long doc-comments in the code ? It looks terrible. But it is useful when reading the code. Maybe I can hide it in a region block. Dodrio has beautiful docs. How did he do it?  
- idea: one phone is too small for a bigger game for more players. But if 4 people put their phones
on the table, the grid is 4x bigger. They must play in the same room, on the same table. That is more entertaining. It can even bigger, no limits.
