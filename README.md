# Idea
Playing the memory game alone is boring.  
Playing it with one friend is better.  
But if both friends just stare in their smartphones, it is still boring.  
What makes memory games (and other board games) entertaining is the company of friends.  
There must be many friends around the table watching one another and stealing moves and laughing at each other.  
Today I assume everybody has a decent smartphone. If all friends open the mem4 game and put their smartphones on the table one near the other, everybody can see them and touch them, this is the closest to a classic board game it gets.  
All the phones will have a 4x4 card grid. If we put 4 smartphones on the table it is now a 8x8 game. That is now much more interesting to play for 4 players.  
It can be played with as many friends as there are: 3,4,5,6,7,8,... More friends - more fun.  
## TODO:
- better documentation. Do I really have to write very long doc-comments in the code ? It looks terrible. But it is useful when reading the code. Maybe I can hide it in a region block. Dodrio has beautiful docs. How did he do it?  
## Changelog
2019-05-24 completed a working version
